## Human-AI Interaction Patterns

### Core Agentic Design Patterns (2024-2025)

Recent research has identified four fundamental patterns that distinguish agentic AI interfaces:

#### 1. Reflection Pattern
- **Definition**: Self-feedback mechanisms where AI agents evaluate and improve their own responses
