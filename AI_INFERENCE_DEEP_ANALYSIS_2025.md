# AI Inference Deep Analysis 2025: The Missing Pieces for Agentic AI Systems

## Executive Summary

AI inference has become the dominant workload in 2025, representing up to **90% of AI operations** compared to just 10% for training. This shift is particularly pronounced in agentic AI systems, where inference costs can be **25x higher** than traditional chatbots due to their iterative reasoning, tool use, and multi-stage decision-making processes.

Yet despite this massive shift, current approaches to AI inference are missing critical components that could unlock the next generation of agentic AI capabilities. This analysis identifies **8 major gaps** and provides actionable strategies for builders.

## 3. Unique Inference Patterns for Agentic AI Systems

### The Agentic Inference Challenge
Agentic AI systems exhibit fundamentally different inference patterns:
