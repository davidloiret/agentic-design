This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.


Evaluate your knowledge => leetcode style / no framework

For each I should add sources etc


I want real world example in Typescript / Python / Rust 
sans Framework 
juste avec BAML



For each pattern I want an example that I can run and modify each time in Typescript / Python / Rust
with and without framework example code

I need reference, I need schema for each


-----

Chat with knowledge

see galileo eval

without any framework and with framework


Add news tab, idea is to get update on different time, user can get email or see a summary of articles, person of interest etc in the area of agentic design (AI, agents etc)

High level system specification.
Generate systems from schema => feed schema to LLM => LLM build for us.
Maybe use lib => example de pattern.

Faire comme excalidraw comme pour les mecs de BAML qui design d'abord dessus
- pouvoir avoir ecrire du code / inline

Instead of a modal I should have a drawer at the left, don't hesitate to take a library to create the drawer if needed

I also want the ability to create directly content inline, like code, much like excalidraw but better with code highliting

Make tradeoff => designing system is about making tradeoff


=> techno agnostic to techno selection, for example graph DAtabase => neo4j or kuzudb (suggestions => open source etc)

Vector database

Building block Hub => vector database => comparaison etc
different de project Hub ? => agentic full project


Generate code from spec directly

## Interactive Pattern Demonstrations

✅ **NEW FEATURE:** Interactive graph demonstrations with React Flow that play scenarios to explain each pattern interactively with step-by-step execution, input/output examples, and visual learning aids.

### Access the Interactive Demo
- Visit `/interactive-demo` to experience the new interactive pattern demonstrations
- Available patterns: Chain of Thought (CoT), Tree of Thoughts (ToT), ReAct Pattern
- Features:
  - Step-by-step visual progression
  - Real-time input/output examples
  - Auto-play and manual controls
  - Zoom and pan functionality
  - Educational explanations for each step

### Usage
1. Select a pattern (CoT, ToT, or ReAct)
2. Use play button for automatic progression or step controls for manual navigation
3. View detailed input/output in the side panel
4. Reset to restart the demonstration


user can add lib etc and say where this is used

Add reference

Person / par domaine fin => AI red teaming etc


Add a listen on each page => so instead of reading we can listen.


on confond techniques et patterns ou c bien de faire ca ?

chain of thought c'est un pattern et pas une technique ?

Patterns => Techniques

ou renommer en catégorie un peu comme mitra attack

ou alors on parle de patterns et catégorie de pattern


--------------



  Techniques/Methods (like Chain-of-Thought):
  - Specific, concrete implementations
  - Well-defined procedures with clear steps
  - Research papers refer to them as "techniques," "methods," or "approaches"
  - Examples: Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thought, ReAct, Self-Correction

  Patterns (the higher-level categories):
  - Abstract design principles or architectural approaches
  - Describe general ways of organizing AI systems
  - Examples: Reasoning Patterns, Prompt Chaining Patterns, Multi-Agent Patterns

  In your codebase, you have the right structure:
  - Categories represent the patterns (e.g., "Reasoning Techniques" category)
  - Techniques represent the specific implementations (e.g., "Chain-of-Thought" technique)

  The literature consistently uses:
  - "Chain-of-Thought prompting technique"
  - "Tree-of-Thought method"
  - "ReAct approach"

  graph RAG

  ---

  help make the right design decision => database selection etc


  Add knowledge structuration / ontology / shacl etc

  Add fine tuning

  RAG should be inside Knowledge Management catégories
  => LLM as judge etc


  Revoir le livre agentic design patterns & blogpost


  Add new indicator for new techniques


  Edge 

  And
  Distributed inference

  Inference
  - Provider
  - Librairie (web, mobile)
  Fine tuning

Ontology => knowledge retrieval

Memory 
Add Human On the loop

Memory vs context management should we have a dedicated category on Memory (such like human perpetual etc)

------------
Anonymisation
Secure Enclave Inference

Embedding / semantic 

Type of models

Open source models etc

model whisper / etc


add inference hardware

add => ask a expert for help

Agentic Design Patterns
Craft reliable AI systems

Pin and save

We are missing coding challenge no ? I don't see it.


- I want a feature to listen content of the website
to not have to read it, I should have girl or man voice that do that for me.

LLM mascote to help learn and follow learning.

Learn pattern and techniques not framework

What about semantic embedding ?

Context engineering tips
Decaying memory => add ressources video etc

Add to Chat⌘L

Make a deepResearch about Chain Of Thought, What it is, how it works, why it is needed, key features; when use it, use cases. You job is to explain to AI system builder how this is working and how/when they should use it. 

Improve the remotion video to be perfect explication.

Pros / cons


Compare technique according to use case (I already have a dedicated table)

Personalized learning roadmap with badge on patterns validated


learning mascot


propose new technique etc


add supabase + nestjs backend for learning hub => prendre la base abelec

Poster video => lien vers agentic design

check remotion license


create battle => learning battle between different user

we should have the ability to go next or previous from techniques

Each technique and category should ve acceble on dedeicated url

chat with content

video sur toute une catégorie avec presentation des differentes techniques


add breadcrumb and category selection indicator

couleur doit etre moins flashy bg opacity

news resumé audio

faire une app mobile

when searching and clicking it should not reset the search.

patterns / techniques

patterns en gros c la catégorie => techniques 

There is an issue, when I click on category, it rerender the navbar, so for example If I have uncollapse a category and click on another it will collapse the previous, this is not wanted, we want to keep the state, maybe memoization can fix this.


in nestjs route slot parallelization are slow when I click, to change a route I need to wait, this is not instant, how to improve this.

make a audio TLDR summary of news


Add inspirating CVE categories such as CVE about MCP etc add a category for that with detail and how to reproduce etc. 


Conduct a deep research on AI red teaming, add factual example, techniques, than I can copy paste, be exhaustif, don't forget anything.

Also add a new category people to follow on this topic.

----------

Save pattern => pin or favoris
used in project


add leaked prompt
=> rating des prompts

Prompt hub ? avec explication highlight des endroits intéressant
Context engineering tips ?


Add CVE 

And methodoloy to find vulnerability in AI systems with checklist etc.

Add suggest new techniques / new patterns / categorie

Add proper sources => for prompt leak
bottom sheet should only be open by default if there is no category and technique selected

When empty => I should have a call to action to open bottom sheet

create a waitlist

add tag so we can search rapidly not by provider but by use case
coding agent, etc for the prompt

Add supply chain attack through hallucination
