## Segment 1: seq-intro
Text: "Sequential chaining breaks complex tasks into manageable steps - each building on the previous output for superior results."
Duration: 8s
Emphasis: sequential chaining, manageable steps, superior results
Timing: Frame 60 - 300
Output: seq-intro.wav
MP3 Output: seq-intro.mp3

## Segment 2: seq-concept
Text: "Instead of one massive prompt, sequential chains create a pipeline where each AI call specializes in one specific task."
Duration: 8s
Emphasis: massive prompt, pipeline, specializes
Timing: Frame 400 - 640
Output: seq-concept.wav
MP3 Output: seq-concept.mp3

## Segment 3: seq-implementation
Text: "Implementation is straightforward - pass the output of each chain as input to the next, creating a data pipeline."
Duration: 8s
Emphasis: straightforward, output, input, data pipeline
Timing: Frame 700 - 940
Output: seq-implementation.wav
MP3 Output: seq-implementation.mp3

## Segment 4: seq-comparison
Text: "Compare this to traditional single prompts - sequential chaining gives you control, transparency, and higher quality."
Duration: 8s
Emphasis: traditional, control, transparency, higher quality
Timing: Frame 1000 - 1240
Output: seq-comparison.wav
MP3 Output: seq-comparison.mp3

## Segment 5: seq-benefits
Text: "Each chain can be optimized independently, debugged easily, and replaced without affecting the entire pipeline."
Duration: 8s
Emphasis: optimized independently, debugged easily, entire pipeline
Timing: Frame 1300 - 1540
Output: seq-benefits.wav
MP3 Output: seq-benefits.mp3

## Segment 6: seq-conclusion
Text: "Sequential chaining transforms complex AI tasks into manageable, transparent, and highly reliable workflows."
