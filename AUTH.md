Authentication and Authorization Service
Manages user identity, authentication flows, and authorization policies using JWT tokens with refresh token rotation. This service handles user registration, login, password management, and multi-factor authentication. It implements role-based access control (RBAC) with fine-grained permissions for different user types (admin, premium, basic). The service maintains user profiles, session management, and integrates with external identity providers through OAuth2/OIDC protocols. It provides token validation endpoints for other services and manages API key generation for programmatic access.
