    description: 'Multi-step prompt orchestration patterns',
    detailedDescription: 'Prompt chaining is a fundamental technique in LLM engineering that breaks complex tasks into smaller, interconnected prompts where each output serves as input for the next step, creating structured reasoning pipelines. Recent research from 2024-2025 demonstrates that this approach achieves up to 15.6% better accuracy than monolithic prompts. The technique has evolved significantly with frameworks like LangChain reporting that average steps per trace have doubled from 2.8 to 7.7 in 2024, with 43% of organizations now using advanced graph-based workflows. Modern implementations include sophisticated variants like feedback loops for iterative refinement, hierarchical chains for complex task decomposition, and parallel synthesis for multi-perspective analysis. These patterns enable transparency in AI reasoning, better error isolation, reduced hallucination through focused prompts, and improved maintainability through modular design.',
