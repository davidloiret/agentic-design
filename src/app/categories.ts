    description: 'Advanced reasoning and thinking techniques',
    detailedDescription: 'Reasoning patterns represent sophisticated cognitive frameworks that enable AI systems to process complex information through structured, multi-layered approaches. These methodologies transform how intelligent agents handle challenging tasks by implementing explicit reasoning chains, systematic problem decomposition, and iterative refinement processes. Unlike traditional single-pass responses, these patterns encourage deeper computational investment during inference, allowing systems to explore multiple solution pathways, validate intermediate conclusions, and self-correct when necessary. The fundamental advantage lies in their ability to make the reasoning process transparent and traceable, which is crucial for building trustworthy AI systems. Modern reasoning patterns also incorporate dynamic resource allocation, where computational effort scales with problem complexity, ensuring optimal performance across diverse scenarios.',

    whyImportant: 'Reasoning patterns are fundamental to building trustworthy AI systems because they bridge the gap between raw computational power and human-like problem-solving. They address the critical challenge of AI interpretability by making decision processes transparent and auditable. In high-stakes applications, understanding how an AI system reached its conclusion is as important as the conclusion itself. These patterns enable AI systems to handle novel situations more effectively by providing structured approaches to break down unfamiliar problems into familiar components, while ensuring reliable performance through systematic validation and iterative refinement.',
