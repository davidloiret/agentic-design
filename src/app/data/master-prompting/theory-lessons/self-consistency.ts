    introduction: `
Self-consistency is a powerful technique that transforms unreliable AI outputs into robust, trustworthy results. By generating multiple independent reasoning paths for the same problem and aggregating their conclusions, self-consistency can reduce error rates by 15-40% on complex reasoning tasks.

This approach leverages the wisdom of crowds principle within a single model, recognizing that while any individual reasoning path might contain errors, the majority consensus across multiple attempts is likely to be correct. It's particularly effective for tasks where there's a clear correct answer but multiple ways to reach it.

        title: 'The Mathematics of Self-Consistency',
        content: `
Self-consistency is grounded in probability theory and ensemble methods:

**Statistical Foundation**
If a model has accuracy p > 0.5 on a task, generating n independent samples and taking majority vote improves accuracy:

\`\`\`
P(majority correct) = Σ(k=⌈n/2⌉ to n) C(n,k) × p^k × (1-p)^(n-k)
\`\`\`

For example:
- Single sample accuracy: 70%
- 3 samples with majority vote: ~78%
- 5 samples with majority vote: ~84%
- 7 samples with majority vote: ~87%

**Variance Reduction**
Self-consistency reduces output variance through averaging:
\`\`\`
Var(majority) ≈ Var(single) / n
\`\`\`

**Independence Assumption**
Key requirement: Samples must be sufficiently independent. Achieved through:
- Temperature variation (0.5-1.0 range)
- Different random seeds
- Prompt variations
- Model checkpoint diversity

**Confidence Scoring**
Confidence = (votes for majority answer) / (total samples)
- 5/5 agreement = 100% confidence
- 4/5 agreement = 80% confidence
- 3/5 agreement = 60% confidence

**Basic Self-Consistency**
\`\`\`python
def self_consistency(prompt, n_samples=5, temperature=0.7):
    responses = []

    # Generate multiple samples
    for _ in range(n_samples):
        response = generate(prompt, temperature=temperature)
        responses.append(response)

    # Extract answers
    answers = [extract_answer(r) for r in responses]

    # Majority vote
    from collections import Counter
    vote_counts = Counter(answers)
    majority_answer = vote_counts.most_common(1)[0]

    confidence = majority_answer[1] / n_samples

    return {
        'answer': majority_answer[0],
        'confidence': confidence,
        'all_answers': answers,
        'vote_distribution': dict(vote_counts)
    }
\`\`\`

**Weighted Self-Consistency**
Weight votes based on reasoning quality:
\`\`\`python
def weighted_self_consistency(prompt, n_samples=5):
    responses = []
    weights = []

    for _ in range(n_samples):
        response = generate(prompt, temperature=0.7)

    # Weighted voting
    weighted_votes = {}
    for response, weight in zip(responses, weights):
        answer = extract_answer(response)
        weighted_votes[answer] = weighted_votes.get(answer, 0) + weight

    # Return highest weighted answer
    best_answer = max(weighted_votes, key=weighted_votes.get)
    total_weight = sum(weights)
    confidence = weighted_votes[best_answer] / total_weight

    return best_answer, confidence
\`\`\`

**Chain-of-Thought Self-Consistency**
Combine with explicit reasoning:
\`\`\`python
def cot_self_consistency(problem, n_samples=5):
    reasonings = []

    prompt = f"""
    Problem: {problem}
    Let's solve this step by step.
    """

    for _ in range(n_samples):
        reasoning = generate(prompt, temperature=0.7)
        reasonings.append(reasoning)

    # Extract final answers from reasonings
    answers = []
    for reasoning in reasonings:
        # Parse the final answer from reasoning
        answer = extract_final_answer(reasoning)
        answers.append({
            'answer': answer,
            'reasoning': reasoning
        })

    # Majority vote on answers
    answer_counts = Counter([a['answer'] for a in answers])
    majority = answer_counts.most_common(1)[0][0]

    # Return majority answer with supporting reasonings
    supporting_reasonings = [
        a['reasoning'] for a in answers if a['answer'] == majority
    ]

    return {
        'answer': majority,
        'confidence': len(supporting_reasonings) / n_samples,
        'reasonings': supporting_reasonings

      },
      {
        title: 'Advanced Self-Consistency Techniques',
        content: `
**Progressive Self-Consistency**
Start with few samples, add more if confidence is low:
\`\`\`python
def progressive_self_consistency(prompt, min_samples=3, max_samples=10):
    samples = []
    confidence_threshold = 0.8

    for i in range(max_samples):
        # Generate new sample
        response = generate(prompt, temperature=0.7)
        samples.append(extract_answer(response))

        if i >= min_samples - 1:
            # Check current confidence
            vote_counts = Counter(samples)
            majority = vote_counts.most_common(1)[0]
            confidence = majority[1] / len(samples)

            if confidence >= confidence_threshold:
                return majority[0], confidence, len(samples)

    # Return best answer even if confidence threshold not met
    final_counts = Counter(samples)
    best = final_counts.most_common(1)[0]
    return best[0], best[1] / len(samples), len(samples)
\`\`\`

**Diverse Prompt Self-Consistency**
Use prompt variations for better independence:
\`\`\`python
def diverse_prompt_self_consistency(problem):
    prompt_templates = [
        "Solve this problem: {problem}",
        "Let's think step by step about: {problem}",
        "Analyze and solve: {problem}",
        "What's the answer to: {problem}",
        "Please work through: {problem}"
    ]

    answers = []
    for template in prompt_templates:
        prompt = template.format(problem=problem)
        response = generate(prompt, temperature=0.5)
        answers.append(extract_answer(response))

    # Majority vote
    vote_counts = Counter(answers)
    return vote_counts.most_common(1)[0][0]
\`\`\`

**Hierarchical Self-Consistency**
Apply at multiple levels:
\`\`\`python
def hierarchical_self_consistency(complex_problem):
    # Level 1: Decompose problem
    decompositions = []
    for _ in range(3):
        decomp = generate(f"Break down: {complex_problem}", temp=0.7)
        decompositions.append(decomp)

    # Level 2: Solve each subproblem
    subproblems = parse_subproblems(best_decomposition)
    subproblem_solutions = []

    for subproblem in subproblems:
        # Apply self-consistency to each subproblem
        solution = self_consistency(subproblem, n_samples=5)
        subproblem_solutions.append(solution)

    # Level 3: Combine solutions
    combinations = []
    for _ in range(3):
        combined = generate(
            f"Combine solutions: {subproblem_solutions}",
            temp=0.5
        )
        combinations.append(combined)

    return majority_vote(combinations)
\`\`\`

**Calibrated Self-Consistency**
Adjust sampling based on problem difficulty:
\`\`\`python
def calibrated_self_consistency(problem):
    # Assess problem difficulty
    difficulty = generate(f"Rate difficulty (1-10): {problem}")

    # Calibrate number of samples
    if difficulty <= 3:
        n_samples = 3
    elif difficulty <= 7:
        n_samples = 5
    else:
        n_samples = 7

    # Calibrate temperature
    temperature = 0.5 + (difficulty / 10) * 0.5

    return self_consistency(problem, n_samples, temperature)

**Beyond Simple Majority Voting:**

1. **Weighted Voting by Confidence**
\`\`\`python

        confidence = response['self_reported_confidence']

    best_answer = max(weighted_votes, key=weighted_votes.get)

2. **Ranked Choice Voting**
\`\`\`python

        rankings = [[a for a in r if a != lowest] for r in rankings]
\`\`\`

3. **Bayesian Aggregation**
\`\`\`python
def bayesian_aggregation(responses, prior_weights=None):
    if prior_weights is None:
        prior_weights = {answer: 1.0 for r in responses for answer in r}

    # Update beliefs based on evidence

    posterior = {k: v/total for k, v in posterior.items()}

    # Return maximum a posteriori estimate

4. **Consistency-Aware Aggregation**
\`\`\`python

**Ideal Use Cases:**

Mathematical Problems
- Arithmetic: +20-30% accuracy improvement
- Algebra: +25-35% improvement
- Word problems: +30-40% improvement

Logical Reasoning
- Deductive logic: +15-25% improvement
- Puzzle solving: +20-30% improvement
- Constraint satisfaction: +25-35% improvement

Code Generation
- Algorithm implementation: +15-20% improvement
- Bug fixing: +20-25% improvement
- Code optimization: +10-15% improvement

**When Self-Consistency Helps Less:**

Creative Tasks
- Writing fiction: May reduce creativity
- Brainstorming: Convergence reduces diversity
- Artistic expression: Consensus isn't meaningful

Subjective Questions
- Opinion-based queries: No "correct" answer
- Preference elicitation: Individual variation is valuable
- Aesthetic judgments: Subjectivity is expected

Factual Retrieval
- Simple facts: Model either knows or doesn't
- Definitions: Multiple samples won't help
- Historical dates: Sampling doesn't add information

**Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
\`\`\`
Value = (Accuracy_Gain × Task_Value) - (Additional_Tokens × Token_Cost)

Example:
- Task value: $100 per correct answer
- Base accuracy: 70%
- Self-consistency accuracy: 85%
- Additional tokens: 5x
- Token cost: $0.01 per 1K

Value gain = (0.85 - 0.70) × $100 = $15
Token cost = 5 × $0.01 = $0.05
Net value = $15 - $0.05 = $14.95 ✓

**Pitfall 1: Insufficient Independence**
Problem: Samples too similar, no diversity benefit

# Bad: Low temperature, identical prompts
for _ in range(5):

# Good: Varied temperature and prompts
