    introduction: `
Reasoning patterns are the cognitive architectures that transform language models from simple responders into sophisticated problem solvers. These patterns determine how agents think through problems, explore solution spaces, and arrive at conclusions.

Just as human reasoning evolved from instinctive responses to abstract thinking, AI reasoning patterns have evolved from simple completions to complex, multi-path exploration systems. Each pattern offers unique advantages for different types of problems.

This lesson explores the full spectrum of reasoning patterns, from the foundational Chain of Thought to cutting-edge approaches like Graph of Thought and Forest of Thoughts.

Understanding the progression of reasoning patterns helps you choose the right approach:

**Generation 1: Direct Prompting**
\`\`\`python
# Simple question â†’ answer
response = llm("What is the capital of France?")
# Output: "Paris"
\`\`\`
- Single-shot response
- No intermediate steps
- Limited to simple queries

**Generation 2: Chain of Thought (CoT)**
\`\`\`python
# Add "think step by step" to trigger reasoning
response = llm("""
Q: If a store has 234 apples and sells 89, then receives a shipment of 123 more, how many apples do they have?
A: Let's think step by step.
""")
# Output shows intermediate calculations
\`\`\`
- Linear reasoning path
- Explicit intermediate steps
- 10-40% accuracy improvement on complex tasks

**Generation 3: Tree of Thoughts (ToT)**
\`\`\`python
# Explore multiple reasoning paths
def tree_of_thoughts(problem):
    # Generate multiple thought branches
    thoughts = [generate_thought(problem) for _ in range(3)]

    # Evaluate each branch
    scores = [evaluate_thought(t) for t in thoughts]

    # Explore promising branches further
    best_thought = thoughts[scores.index(max(scores))]
    return explore_branch(best_thought)
\`\`\`
- Multiple reasoning paths
- Backtracking capability
- Heuristic-guided search

**Generation 4: Graph of Thought (GoT)**
\`\`\`python
# Non-linear reasoning with arbitrary connections
class GraphOfThought:
    def reason(self, problem):
        # Build thought graph
        graph = self.initialize_graph(problem)

        # Add nodes and edges dynamically
        while not self.is_solved(graph):
            new_thoughts = self.generate_thoughts(graph)
            connections = self.find_connections(new_thoughts, graph)
            graph.update(new_thoughts, connections)

        return self.extract_solution(graph)
\`\`\`
- Non-linear exploration
- Thought merging and splitting
- Complex dependency handling

**Generation 5: Meta-Reasoning Patterns**
\`\`\`python
# Reasoning about reasoning
class MetaReasoner:
    def solve(self, problem):
        # Analyze problem characteristics
        problem_type = self.classify_problem(problem)

        # Select optimal reasoning pattern
        pattern = self.select_pattern(problem_type)

        # Monitor and adjust reasoning process
        solution = pattern.solve(problem)
        while not self.is_satisfactory(solution):
            pattern = self.adapt_pattern(pattern, solution.feedback)
            solution = pattern.solve(problem)

        return solution
\`\`\`
- Pattern selection based on problem type
- Dynamic strategy adjustment
- Self-monitoring and correction

Chain of Thought remains the foundation of agent reasoning:

**How CoT Works**

        # Verify each step
        for i, step in enumerate(steps):
            if not self.verify_step(step, steps[:i]):
                # Regenerate from this point
                steps = self.repair_reasoning(steps, i)

        return self.extract_answer(steps)
\`\`\`

**Advanced CoT Techniques**

1. **Zero-Shot CoT**
\`\`\`python
prompt = f"{problem}\n\nLet's think step by step."
\`\`\`

2. **Few-Shot CoT**
\`\`\`python
prompt = f"""

Solution: {example1_steps}

Example 2: {example2_problem}
Solution: {example2_steps}

Now solve: {problem}

\`\`\`

3. **Self-Consistency CoT**
\`\`\`python
def self_consistency_cot(problem, n_samples=5):
    # Generate multiple reasoning chains
    solutions = []
    for _ in range(n_samples):
        chain = generate_cot(problem, temperature=0.7)
        answer = extract_answer(chain)
        solutions.append(answer)

    # Vote on most common answer
    return Counter(solutions).most_common(1)[0][0]
\`\`\`

4. **Least-to-Most CoT**
\`\`\`python
def least_to_most_cot(complex_problem):
    # Decompose into subproblems
    subproblems = decompose(complex_problem)

    # Sort by complexity
    subproblems.sort(key=lambda p: p.complexity)

        solutions[subproblem.id] = solve_with_context(subproblem, context)

**When to Use CoT:**
- Mathematical word problems
- Multi-step logical reasoning
- Sequential procedures
- Causal analysis
