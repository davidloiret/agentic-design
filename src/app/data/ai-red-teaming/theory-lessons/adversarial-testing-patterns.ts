    introduction: `Adversarial testing patterns are systematic approaches to finding weaknesses in AI systems through deliberate manipulation and exploitation. This lesson covers advanced techniques for generating adversarial examples, poisoning training data, extracting model information, and testing system robustness.`,

    sections: [
      {
        title: 'Adversarial Examples',
        content: `Adversarial examples are inputs deliberately crafted to cause misclassification or unexpected behavior in AI models. Understanding how to create and defend against these attacks is crucial for building robust AI systems.`
      },
      {
        title: 'Data Poisoning Attacks',
        content: `Data poisoning involves injecting malicious data into training sets to compromise model behavior. This can lead to backdoors, biased predictions, or degraded performance on specific inputs.`
      },
      {
        title: 'Model Extraction and Inversion',
        content: `Model extraction attacks attempt to steal or recreate a target model through API queries, while model inversion attacks try to recover training data from model outputs.`
      },
      {
        title: 'Black-Box Testing Strategies',
        content: `Black-box testing evaluates AI systems without access to internal architecture or weights, using only inputs and outputs to discover vulnerabilities.`
      }
    ],

    keyTakeaways: [
      'Adversarial testing requires systematic and creative approaches',
      'Different attack vectors target different aspects of AI systems',
      'Understanding attacks is essential for building defenses',
      'Continuous testing is necessary as models and threats evolve'
