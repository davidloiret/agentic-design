  content: {
    introduction: `Defense mechanisms for AI systems encompass techniques to protect against adversarial attacks, ensure robustness, preserve privacy, and maintain system integrity. This lesson covers defensive strategies from input validation to advanced certified defenses.`,

    sections: [
      {
        title: 'Adversarial Training',
        content: `Adversarial training improves model robustness by including adversarial examples in the training process. This technique helps models learn to correctly classify both clean and adversarially perturbed inputs.`
      },
      {
        title: 'Input Validation and Sanitization',
        content: `Input validation techniques detect and filter potentially adversarial inputs before they reach the model. This includes statistical analysis, anomaly detection, and format verification.`
      },
      {
        title: 'Certified Defenses',
        content: `Certified defenses provide mathematical guarantees about model behavior within specific perturbation bounds. Techniques like randomized smoothing and interval bound propagation offer provable robustness.`
      },
      {
        title: 'Ensemble Defenses',
        content: `Ensemble methods combine multiple models or defense mechanisms to improve overall robustness. Diversity in the ensemble makes it harder for attackers to craft universal adversarial examples.`
      },
      {
        title: 'Privacy-Preserving Techniques',
        content: `Differential privacy, federated learning, and secure multi-party computation protect against data extraction and model inversion attacks while maintaining utility.`
      }

    keyTakeaways: [
      'Defense-in-depth strategies combine multiple protective layers',
      'No single defense is perfect against all attacks',
      'Trade-offs exist between robustness and model performance',
      'Continuous monitoring and updating of defenses is essential'
