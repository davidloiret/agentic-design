I want you to improve my following taxonomy of patterns / techniques about Agentic AI systems. Make a deep research on latest patterns and techniques on academic and authoritative sources, use canonical name only, for each technique you should find a verifiable source from academic paper that name this technique, if you cannot find it, technique is maybe wrong and should be removed or renamed. Find gaps in patterns / techniques and remove redundant one. Don't use vendor name but use industry adoption term and academic term.
