Cloud and Infrastructure
The architecture is designed for Kubernetes deployment with Helm charts for configuration management. It utilizes cloud-native services including managed databases, object storage, and container registries. The system implements Infrastructure as Code using Terraform for reproducible deployments across different environments. Container images are built using multi-stage Docker builds optimized for security and size, with regular vulnerability scanning integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
