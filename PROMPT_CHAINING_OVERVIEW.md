# Prompt Chaining and Sequential Chaining: Comprehensive Overview

## Introduction

Prompt chaining is a fundamental technique in Large Language Model (LLM) engineering that involves breaking down complex tasks into a series of smaller, interconnected prompts. In this approach, the output of one prompt serves as the input for the next, creating a structured reasoning process that guides the LLM through multi-step problem solving.

## Core Concepts and Definitions

### What is Prompt Chaining?

Prompt chaining is a technique where multiple prompts are linked together in a sequence, with each prompt building upon the results of previous ones. This modular approach enables LLMs to tackle complex tasks that would be difficult or impossible to handle with a single monolithic prompt.

### Sequential Chaining

Sequential chaining is the most fundamental form of prompt chaining, where prompts follow a linear sequence. Each step has a singular input/output, and the output of one step directly feeds into the next. This creates a pipeline-like workflow that processes information in stages.

## Types of Prompt Chaining

### 1. Linear/Sequential Chains
- Prompts follow a strict sequential order
- Each prompt builds upon the previous one
- Suitable for step-by-step tasks like document summarization or code generation
- Example: Research → Analysis → Writing → Editing

### 2. Parallel Chains
- Multiple prompts execute simultaneously
- Results are aggregated or synthesized
- Useful for gathering multiple perspectives or processing different aspects concurrently
- Example: Analyzing competitor pricing, demographics, and trends in parallel

### 3. Conditional/Branching Chains
- Incorporate conditional logic based on outputs
- Different paths taken based on intermediate results
- Useful for decision trees and adaptive workflows
- Example: Customer support routing based on query classification

### 4. Recursive/Feedback Chains
- Outputs are fed back as inputs for iterative refinement
- Repeat until quality criteria or convergence is achieved
- Helpful for creative writing or optimization tasks
- Example: Generate → Evaluate → Improve → Repeat

### 5. Hierarchical Chains
- Organize prompts in parent-child relationships
- Multi-level task decomposition
- Suitable for complex project planning or system design
- Example: Business plan with nested market analysis, financial projections
